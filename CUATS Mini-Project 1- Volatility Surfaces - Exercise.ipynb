    "# Implied Volatility and Volatility Surfaces\n",
    "This CUATS mini-project focuses on computing the implied volatility of an option and plotting the volatility surface. We will also discuss how one can use volatility surfaces, or values derived from them, in trading strategies. This document also has both mathematical and coding exercises for you to complete as you read through the document (similar to the coding sessions ran during term). \n",
    "\n",
    "The CUATS mini-projects are intended to be a deeper dive into a topic, so this will be longer and more involved than a typical coding session. If you get stuck on the exercises (and can't progress even after looking at the hints) please go to the GitHub page for this project and ask for help. Also, where possible, the exercises are made such that you should be able to skip one and still make progress until near the end of the document where everything comes together, so it should be possible to skip to the next part if you're waiting for a response to your questions on GitHub.\n",

    "## 2.1 - The Black-Scholes model\n",
    "A common method to price options is the Black-Scholes model (though there are others, some of which are discussed in the extension). If we consider an option created at time $t = 0$ it will have the following (widely known) parameters:\n",
    "- T - the time at which the option expires.\n",
    "- K - the strike price of the option.\n",
    "- $S_0$ - the price of the stock at time $t=0$.\n",
    "- r - the risk-free interest rate available.\n",
    "Then if we want to know the fair price of an option in the Black-Scholes model at time $t$ the following parameters are relevant:\n",
    "- t - the current time.\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ - the standard deviation of the stocks returns, also known as the volatility.\n",
    "- $\\mu$ - the drift rate (average rate at which we expect stock prices to increase).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Black-Scholes price of a call option at time $t$ with strike $K$, underlying price $S_t$ at time $t$ and expiration time $T$ is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$C(S_t,t) = S_t \\times \\Phi(d_1) - K \\times \\Phi(d_2) e^{-r(T-t)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal random variable and:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}} \\left\\{ ln\\left(\\frac{S_t}{K}\\right) + \\left(r + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)(T-t)\\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_2 =  \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}} \\left\\{ ln\\left(\\frac{S_t}{K}\\right) + \\left(r - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)(T-t)\\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, one can write $d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma \\sqrt{T-t} $. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a put option, one can show using put-call parity that the price is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(S_t, t) = K \\times \\Phi(-d_2)e^{-r(T-t)} - S_t \\times \\Phi(-d_1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last of our parameters, $\\mu$, does not appear in either of the pricing formula. This is because we value options under something called the risk neutral measure. The full explanation of this is quite mathematical, and beyond the scope of this project. A (quite simplified) explanation for why the drift $\\mu$ does not feature in the Black-Scholes price is as follows:\n",
    "- Consider a call option with strike $K=0$. At the expiry time T, this would payout the exact price of the stock at time T, i.e. S_T.\n",
    "- Therefore, the option pays out exactly the same value as:\n",
    "    - Buying the stock right now, costing S_t\n",
    "    - Selling it at time T, paying out S_T\n",
    "- Therefore, the option should cost exactly the same value as the stocks current value S_t (and there is no drift).\n",
    "- More generally, if there was some known drift that everyone agreed on, then it should already be priced into the current value of the stock and so doesn't need to be included in the pricing formula. \n",
    "\n",
    "One may debate whether these assumptions are reasonable. Interest rates are not fixed over time, and there's also strong evidence that volatility is not constant over time. These are simply the assumptions of the Black-Scholes model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now determine the theoretical Black-Scholes price of any option. As the current time $t$, risk-free rate $r$, current price $S_t$, strike price $K$ and expiration date/time $T$ are all known, and as $\\mu$ doesn't affect the Black-Scholes price, we can compute the price provided we know the volatility $\\sigma$."

    "## 2.2 - Volatility\n",
    "From the previous section, if we know the volatility we can compute the (Black-Scholes) price of any given option using the above formulae. The volatility that's important for pricing is the volatility of the underlying asset over the time $[t,T]$. As the current time is $t$, this interval is in the future (so we don't know what it is yet). To remedy this, one can use a range of methods to estimate the future volatility. The simplest way is to use the historical volatility (the standard deviation of the log returns, for further details see [here](https://www.macroption.com/historical-volatility-calculation/)) over some time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method may perform well in some cases, but consider the following:\n",
    "- Say the underlying asset is stock of company A. \n",
    "- Company A is a pharmaceutical company that produces drugs, and over the past year they've been working on a promising new drug which would revolutionise the treatment of some widespread disease (and lead to massive profits for the company).\n",
    "- This drug has a clinical trial in the next three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly if the drug trial is successful, company A is more likely to be profitable in the future and so its share price will increase. On the other hand if it is unsuccessful, company A's share price will likely decrease. In either case, we would expect to see a large change in share prices (and so we should price with a higher volatility than the historic volatility would suggest) for an option expiring in a bit over 3 months. Therefore, in this case the realised volatility (the volatility the prices will actually have had over the interval $[t,T]$) may be much higher than historical levels. "

    "To fix these issues, models could be developed for different possible conditions companies are in, and investors will generally buy and sell options based on the volatility they (or their models) think the underlying assets prices will have.

This volatility $\\sigma_1$ is known as the implied volatility (IV) of that option and is the focus of this project. Note that different options can have different strikes and expiration dates and will naturally have different prices. This can lead to (sometimes vastly) different implied volatilities. \n"

    "As the implied volatility can be different for different options, one may wish to get a full picture and use all of the data available on the options chain (an options chain is the listing of all option contracts for a particular underlying asset. It's usually split into calls and puts). This gives a better idea of how investors might expect volatility to change over time, and in what ways the stock may be more or less likely to move. As there are many strikes and expiration dates (often well over 100) it is difficult to see this when presented as a table. \n",

    "- Time to maturity as the x axis\n",

    "As discussed in Part 1, now that we have the options data we need to compute the implied volatility. If you were looking closely in the previous few sections, you may have noticed that yfinance reports the implied volatility of the options. One could simply use this to plot the volatility surface and skip this section entirely. However:\n",
    "- What if you wanted to plot the volatility surface when using a different pricing model (e.g. the Bachelier model - see the extensions)?\n",
    "- What if you needed to get a fast, approximate value for an implied volatility?\n",
    "- What if the provider in a particular market didn't give implied volatilities for the assets you wished to trade with?\n",
    "- How are you sure the providers implied volatilities are correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "and of course, the process of computing implied volatilities is quite interesting. It's a relatively simple problem to understand, but there are many different approaches to get accurate and fast estimates of the implied volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1 we noted that:\n",
    "1. The implied volatility $\\sigma_1$ is the volatility such that the Black-Scholes price of the option is equal to the current market price\n",
    "2. The Black-Scholes price of an option is continuous and increasing as the volatility changes (when the other parameters are fixed).\n",
    "therefore, if we write $f(\\sigma)$ as the Black-Scholes price of an option with time $t$ price $S_t$, strike $K$, expiration time/date $T$, risk-free rate $r$ and volatility $\\sigma$, the implied volatility $\\sigma_1$ is the (unique from 2.) value such that $f(\\sigma_1) = V$ where $V$ is the market price of the option.\n",

    "Now we look at some of the drawbacks of the NR method that are relevant to Black-Scholes prices:\n",
    "- We can only compute numerical estimates of the Black-Scholes price, and these rely on $\\Phi$. SciPy's normal CDF is only so accurate, as can be seen by the fact that norm.cdf(10) == norm.cdf(9) evaluates to TRUE, i.e. it cannot distinguish these from one another. For this reason, one generally tries to avoid computing implied volatilities with large $d_1$ values (i.e. deeply in the money options). Instead, one can compute the implied volatility mostly with near the money or out of the money options, where $d_1$ is smaller / negative. norm.cdf(-10) != norm.cdf(-9), so we still have some precision when evaluating the function here.\n",
    "- The Black-Scholes price, when considered only as a function of $\\sigma$, is concave for small $\\sigma$ and convex for large $\\sigma$. This is problematic because our estimates can overshoot the true value (sometimes by large amounts) and lead to it taking lots of steps to converge or to it diverging completely. We will illustrate this problem with the NR method by applying it to another function.\n",
    "- Even when the method does converge, it can take many iterations to get \"near\" the root before it starts to converge quickly (so it would help to have some sensible initial guess).\n",

    "We will now illustrate the second of these drawbacks on the function $f(x) = tanh(x) = \\frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x}+e^{-x}}$. To do so, we will use a way to plot the iterations of the Newton Raphson method."

    "From this plot, one can see that for our starting value of 1.15, the fact the function is convex for x less than the root and concave for x greater than the root mean that, when we start far from x, our estimates overshoot. Furthermore, they overshoot and increase in magnitude (from 1.15 to -1.318 to 2.156 et cetera). The next step after -16.499 is at x = 53,536,908,600,954 (53 trillion) which is extremely far from the root. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the Black-Scholes price is somewhat similar to this function, but perhaps slightly better behaved as it's less common for errors to grow over time. Still, in some cases if the initial guess is far too low, it overshoots to extremely large values and takes a while to converge, or reaches a negative value (which is clearly incorrect as the volatility is non negative). \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to handle this is to use a hybrid of the bisection method and the Newton-Raphson method. The basic idea is to start with some (possibly quite large) interval containing the root, then to compute the next point of the NR method from the current best estimate (initially the midpoint, but if NR performs well then the previous NR iterate). If this next point is outside of the interval (i.e. Newton-Raphson overshoots) or is otherwise not converging quickly enough, it uses the bisection method. If not, it splits the region based on whether the next point of the NR method is positive or negative (above or below the root). This guarantees convergence and takes advantage of the fast convergence. An excellent book on [Numerical Recipes in C](https://www.grad.hr/nastava/gs/prg/NumericalRecipesinC.pdf) contains C code for this algorithm. (Newton Raphson is in section 9.4, starting on page 362). This hybrid approach is similar to the more common Brent's method, which we will now discuss."

    "Brent's method also uses a hybrid of bisection and other algorithms, however instead of using Newton Raphson it uses a combination of:\n",
    "- The bisection method\n",
    "- The secant method\n",
    "- Inverse quadratic interpolation - This converges slightly faster than the secant method when near the root but can have poor initial performance, and when certain values coincide it can't be computed at all. We only use it when it can be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefit of Brent's algorithm over the hybrid NR method is that it does not require the derivative. For our purposes, we have a derivative (and it's fast to compute) so this isn't much of a benefit. In fact, for determining implied volatilities the previous method will likely be slightly faster than Brent's method on average. However, Brent's method is much more widely applicable. For pricing more exotic options there is no closed form expression for the derivative so Brent's method is more widely used. Furthermore, Brent's method can be used for finding roots of other functions where the derivative is costly to compute and so it is likely to be more useful in other root finding problems you encounter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The secant method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is very similar to the Newton-Raphson method covered above, however instead of dividing by the derivative we divide by an approximation to it. More specifically we use\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_n = x_{n-1} - f(x_{n-1}) * \\frac{x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}}{f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we're replacing the $f'(x_{n-1})$ with the finite difference approximation $\\frac{f(x_{n-1}) - f(x_{n-2})}{x_{n-1}-x_{n-2}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method has a slightly worse convergence than Newton Raphson as we're approximating the derivative, but when it is costly to evaluate the derivative it can do each step much more quickly leading to better overall convergence. Furthermore, one can save the past values of $f(x_{n-1})$, $f(x_{n-2})$ to use for future steps so after the first initial step only a single evaluation of $f(x_{n-1})$ is needed to get $x_n$ from $x_{n-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The order of convergence when near the root is around 1.618, meaning approximately 1.6 times more digits are accurate at each step. This is worse than the Newton-Raphson method's 2, but still a fairly good convergence rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inverse quadratic interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "This method builds on the secant method, trying to improve the convergence rates by using more past function values and iterates. It uses quadtratic interpolation to fit a quadratic that approximates $f^{-1}(y)$. One can substitute in the value $y=0$ and rearrange to get the recurrence relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x_{n+1} = \\frac{f(x_{n-1}) f(x_n)}{(f(x_{n-2})-f(x_{n-1}))(f(x_{n-2})-f(x_{n}))}x_{n-2} + \\frac{f(x_{n-2}) f(x_n)}{(f(x_{n-1})-f(x_{n-2}))(f(x_{n-1})-f(x_{n}))}x_{n-1} $$\n",
    "$$+\\frac{f(x_{n-2}) f(x_{n-1})}{(f(x_{n})-f(x_{n-2}))(f(x_{n})-f(x_{n-1}))}x_{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if $f(x_{n-1}) \\approx f(x_{n-2})$ we can clearly see both of the first two terms become very large, and when $f(x_{n-1}) = f(x_{n-2})$ we cannot evaluate them. More generally we run into issues whenever $f(x_{n-2}), f(x_{n-1}), f(x_n)$ are not distinct. Like the secant method, we can save past values to reduce the amount of $f(x)$ calls the function uses and speed up computations significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of convergence for this method when near the root is around 1.84 (so a bit better than the secant method but worse than NR). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of it's poor behaviour when $f(x_{n-2}), f(x_{n-1}), f(x_n)$ are not distinct, or are close to one another, inverse quadratic interpolation is rarely used. It's main use is in Brent's method because when the estimates are inaccurate it swaps to the bisection method instead of failing."

It's purpose is to ensure that the bisection method is used when the secant / inverse quadratic interpolation methods are performing poorly. As these can perform poorly in several different ways (overshooting, undershooting and taking too long to converge) there are several different conditions and if any of them are met Brent's method uses bisection instead of interpolation to avoid the poor behaviour. The full list is:\n",
    "- If the previous step used the bisection method:\n",
    "    - If $|b - b_{prev}| <$ delta (a small positive value), use bisection. This is to ensure that the interpolation method isn't undershooting and converging extremely slowly.\n",
    "    - If $|s - b| > 1/2 * |b-b_{prev}|$, use bisection. This is to ensure the new guess is no worse than the halving of the interval we would observe with the bisection method.\n",
    "- If the previous step used an interpolation method:\n",
    "    - If $|b_{prev}- b_{2\\_ prev}| <$ delta, use bisection. This is to ensure that the interpolation method isn't undershooting and converging extremely slowly.\n",
    "    - If $|s - b| > 1/2 * |b_{prev} - b_{2\\_ prev}|$, use bisection. This is to ensure the new guess is no worse than the halving of the interval we would observe with the bisection method.\n",
    "- Lastly, if $s$ does not lie between $(3a + b)/4$ and $b$, use bisection. Clearly, if $s$ is on the other side of $b$ to the interval, then $b$ must be closer to the root, and the bisection method should be used instead of the interpolation method. The other side, $(3a + b)/4$, is similar, and this particular weighted average of $a$ and $b$ is used because it reduces the analytical maximum number of steps in the worst case."

    "## 5.2 - Interpolating on volatility surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of modern research is on finding methods to interpolate / fit models to a set of implied volatilities in a way that doesn't create arbitrage opportunities and has low errors. It is difficult to include the conditions of convexity and of not allowing calendar arbitrage (One can perform a change of variables and express the terms involved in the volatility surface as other variables. In these, no calendar arbitrage is equivalent to one of the variables increasing with respect to another). Because of these difficulties in specifying interpolation methods, a common idea is to have a parameterized model which, for any combination of parameter values, guarantees no arbitrage. One can then fit this model (by, for instance, minimising the RMSE). \n",
    "\n",
    "A basic model that aims to fit parameters to our implied volatilities is the SVI model (see: [Arbitrage free SVI Volatility Surfaces](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2033323)) which was originally devised at Merrill Lynch in 1999. The idea behind this model is to (roughly) fit the observed option prices, but to also ensure that no arbitrage opportunities exist on the resulting surface. A proper understanding of this model, and how to fit it, requires a good understanding of stochastic calculus, and is included as an optional extension exercise. To highlight how difficult it is to ensure a volatility surface has no arbitrage, the original SVI model actually can have arbitrage opportunities (and even ones for realistic data - see: [Arbitrage Free Implied Volatility Surfaces\n",
    "](https://talus.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/pubs/publist/preprints/2010/roper-9.pdf), page 20-21). There are some extensions / modifications to the SVI model that do ensure it remains arbitrage free (see the extension section of the references).\n",

    "- Linear interpolation - This method applies linear interpolation horizontally, then vertically, between points in our region. It generally performs poorly for volatility surfaces as it can (quite commonly) lead to a surface including calendar arbitrage.\n",
    "- Cubic spline interpolation - This method estimates a smooth cubic curve that goes through every point. It is widely used for volatility surface interpolation. Unfortunately, this method may also not be arbitrage free as it doesn't preserve the convexity of option prices.It is also outperformed by other more modern methods that are both faster to compute and more accurate.\n",

    "There are several ways one can interpolate \"linearly\". One method is to compute (using some other method, possibly also interpolation) implied volatility along a line of fixed time to expiry, then to perform linear interpolation between the slices. One can show (for instance in [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2175001) by Fabien Le Floc'h) that linear interpolation is not guaranteed to avoid an arbitrage, which is one reason why it may be unwise to use linear interpolations between slices. We aren't going to use exactly this approach, but it is entirely possible that our method will lead to a volatility surface containing an arbitrage for similar reasons. \n",

One such pckage in R is akima which is based on [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/355780.355786) by Hiroshi Akima).

    "All hope is not lost. There are many other things one may wish to consider when producing sensible volatility surface plots to lower the chances of arbitrage opportunities and inaccuracies even when using a method that doesn't guarantee an arbitrage-free surface. Some things to think about include:\n",
    "- Data quality in financial markets is imperfect and when data is missing we will sometimes get prices of 0 for the bid/ask/current price (which are clearly incorrect). This will wreak havoc on the model if they aren't checked and protected against. At the moment we default to the last traded price in these situations.\n",
    "- The recency of data can have a big impact. In some cases the most recent price is quite old and would no longer be a sensible price (i.e. the underlying has changed value significantly since then). Furthermore, sometimes options are traded on a market with different trading times to that of the underlying, which can lead to prices for one being more recent than the other and making our implied volatilities incorrect.\n",
    "- There are several options for which prices to use. One can use the bid, the ask, the midpoint of the bid and the ask and (for more liquid markets) the most recent price. One may also want to include information about the size of the spread as this is very important when considering arbitrage opportunities (even if a theoretical arbitrage may exist, if the spread is large it will not be profitable).\n",
    "- If one uses the midpoint (as we have) it is  possible for there to be no arbitrage in the real market but an arbitrage opportunity may appear to exist when one looks only at the midpoints. For this reason it can make sense to ignore prices where the spread is particularly large.\n",
    "- Similarly, out of date / incorrect option prices can lead to non monotonic prices as the strike/time to maturity changes (which is again quite problematic, as it also creates arbitrage opportunities)\n",
    "- Some exchanges (For instance ICE, EUREX) send settlement prices - the price at which trading the asset closes / was last traded for. If they haven't had a trade in a few days, they may still provide a settlement price which is far from the trading price of similar options and would lead to an arbitrage if included.\n",
    "- Using primarly out of the money options - If one uses in the money options, these have generally higher prices and larger spreads (making the bid vs midpoint vs ask vs most recent traded price choice much more impactful). We can see in some places our implied volatilities seem to be changing rapidly for different strike prices. One plausible reason for this is that some strike prices have call option data while others have puts, so when either the call or put prices are inaccurate, we get these poorly behaved oscillations.\n",
    "- Exercise 13: Give another reason (involving computing the implied volatilities from a \"correct\" stock price) for why we may wish to not consider deeply in the money options.\n",

    "## 6.1 - Volatility Skew\n",
    "Volatility skew is the general term for the shape of the cross section of the volatility surface with a fixed time to expiry (strikes varying). Typically the words \"Volatility skew\" (also \"negative skew\" or \"reverse skew\") on their own refer to the case where we have higher implied volatilities for low strike prices than for high strike prices. The most common reason for this that investors are willing to pay a premium for put options to protect against large market crashes. Some trading strategies (including one that was in a coding session last year called VolatilityRiskPremium) involve selling these puts to take advantage of this premium as the strategies suppose that investors are overpaying out of fear of a big crash.\n"

    "### 6.1.1 - Positive / forward skew\n",
    "Another type of volatility skew is positive / forward skew. This, as you would expect, is the opposite of negative / reverse skew. Implied volatility for high strikes is higher than it is for low strikes. This suggests market participants are expecting a fairly sharp increase in prices, and are willing to pay a little bit extra to make a profit off of the increase. Positive skew is commonly found in commodities like gold and oil. One reason for this with gold and other \"safe haven\" assets is that in market crashes, people tend to buy gold and other precious metals. Oil, as well as other commodities that are needed to make other products, can have sudden demand surges where lots of people need them causing prices to rise suddenly which can also lead to positive skew."

    "### 6.1.2 - Flat / no skew\n",
    "This refers to when the implied volatility is (roughly) the same across options. In these cases, investors expectations of future returns perfectly match the log-normal distribution that the Black-Scholes model predicts. This doessn't, however, mean that the volatility is similar to historical levels. Often changes in the overall height of the volatility surface can be as important as the shape."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### 6.1.3 - Volatility smiles\n",
    "One common shape for the volatility skew to take is a \"smile\", with higher implied volatilities further from the strike price and lower implied volatilities closer to the strike. There are several plausible explanations for volatility smiles, including:\n",
    "- Demand is higher for in / out of the money options than at (or near) the money ones, so they're more expensive and therefore have a higher implied volatility.\n",
    "- Market participants expect a higher probability of \"rare\" market events (i.e. future stock prices follow a platykurtic distribution, a one with thinner tails than a normal distribution). Many modern option pricing models predict the true chances of \"rare\" market events as higher than that of Black-Scholes. They therefore have different (larger) estimates of the changes of a massive increase / decrease in price than the Black-Scholes model predicts leading to higher implied volatilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "One piece of evidence supporting the \"market participants expect a higher probability of rare events\" hypothesis is that before the 1987 crash, volatility surfaces were much flatter. After 1987, market participants realised that these \"rare\" events were much more common than the Black-Scholes model would predict and implied volatilities far from the strike increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some research also suggests there is a relationship between how \"strong\" / curved the volatility smirk is and the future performance of the underlying. Also, if investors expect the underlying to perform poorly, they may buy OTM puts for downside protection (increasing the implied volatility for low strikes) and if they expect the underlying to perform well, they may buy OTM calls. Hence, the current volatility surface can give some indications of expected future performance."

    "### 6.1.4 - Inverted volatility smiles\n",
    "In some (generally rarer) cases, implied volatility can be highest near the money and lower far from the money, leading to an \"inverted smile\" (or frown, but inverted smile is the more common term). There are some meaningful reasons for this:\n",
    "- Market participants expect a lower probability of \"rare\" market events (i.e. future stock prices follow a platykurtic distribution, a one with thinner tails than a normal distribution)\n",
    "- When a significant jump in stock price is likely to occur at a predictable time, inverted volatility smiles tend to occur. This is because the probability the stock being near its current price in the future is low, and it is more likely to be further from the current strike. Some real world examples of this include: \n",
    "    - When a pharmaceutical company has a drug that's about to finish the last clinical trial (if successful, the share price increases massively, if unsuccessful, the share price decreases massively)\n",
    "    - When a large tech company is about to release an earnings report (if the earnings are good the price will jump up, if poor it will fall rapidly)\n",
    "    - For large sectors of the market: when a large election (i.e. for the US president) is about to take place between candidates with very different views (i.e. one will bring harsh regulation and higher taxes, while the other promises deregulation and tax cuts)\n",
    "    - For large sectors of the market: When the Federal Open Market Committee is about to release the interest rate announcement for the coming months\n",
    "There are models devoted to determining sensible options prices prior to earnings announcements (and other big shifts of this nature). For instance [this paper](https://business.columbia.edu/sites/default/files-efs/pubfiles/6051/DJ_2006.pdf) discusses the improvements that can be made when one takes into account earnings announcements. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, jump diffusion models are used to get better prices for options both in cases of inverted volatility smiles and more generally. There are a range of different jump diffusion models and many involve too much stochastic calculus to be included here. For a more detailed review of jump diffusion models, see [this paper](https://www.columbia.edu/~sk75/MagSci02.pdf).\n"

    "## 6.2 - Volatility term structure\n",
    "This refers to how the implied volatility changes for different times to expiry with the same strike price. These can change based on lots of important information in the markets. For instance, the impact of a successful or failing drug trial can lead to higher implied volatility on options just after the trial than just before. Generally options expiring just after the event have a larger change in implied volatility than those expiring much later than the event. Several events can cause increases in implied volatility observable in the term structure including:\n",
    "- US Treasury bills have increased volatlity just before short-term interest rates are announced\n",
    "- Commodities like corn show increased volatility prior to the announcement of harvest forecasts\n",
    "\n",
    "Volatility term structures can more generally be:\n",
    "- increasing, so the market expects higher volatility far in the future than in the short term\n",
    "- decreasing, the market exprects lower volatility far in the future than in the short term\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the term structures are rarely truly monotonic, and whether a term structure is increasing or decreasing is determined by the general pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some reasons for increasing volatility term structures include future supply disruptions (i.e. if there's an expectation of a large war in a couple months, and in this war one of the participants is a major oil exporter, the volatility of oil prices will be much higher in the future than tomorrow).\n",
    "\n",
    "Far in the future implied volatilities are generally fairly similar to historic volatilities. One possible reason behind this gradual return to a more \"normal\" lower volatility is said to be because a stock cannot have extremely high volatility for a long time, and must eventually revert to it's historical mean. Therefore, if the current short term implied volatility is particularly high then the long term volatility should be lower than the short term and we get a decreasing implied volatility.\n"

    "- Different pricing models:\n",
    "    - One alternative to the Black-Scholes model is the Bachelier model. This model assumes S_t is a normally distributed variable instead of a log-normally distributed one which leads to the possibility of prices being negative! This is generally seen as a downside, since stocks shouldn't have negative values. However, in 2020 oil prices dropped so sharply that for a time they were negative, and at that time some exchanges swapped to the Bachelier implied volatility instead of the Black-Scholes implied volatility. Fortunately, the Bachelier IV can be computed very quickly without an iterative algorithm. A great paper for further reading on the Bachelier model is this: [A Black-Scholes user's guide to the Bachelier model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08686). It should have all the information you need to understand the model and to make a Bachelier volatility surface (as well as much more)."
